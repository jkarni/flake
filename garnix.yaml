    # What builds to include. This is a list of *attribute matchers*, of the form `x.y.z` or `x.y`. For example, `packages.x86_64-linux.*`, or `*.*`. Two-place matchers only match two-place matchers, and three-place matchers only match three-place matchers. '*' is the wildcard.

  exclude: # optional
    # What builds to exclude. This is a list of *attribute matchers*, of the form `x.y.z` or `x.y`. For example, `packages.x86_64-linux.*`, or `*.*`. Two-place matchers only match two-place matchers, and three-place matchers only match three-place matchers. '*' is the wildcard. This is applied *after* the 'include'. Thus, if something matches both the 'include' and the 'exclude', it will be excluded.
